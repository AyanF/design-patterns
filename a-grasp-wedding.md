**Wedding Plan Implementing GRASP Patterns**

In planning a wedding, we can apply the GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) patterns to ensure a well-organized and memorable event. Let's explore how each pattern can be embodied by different individuals involved in the wedding planning process.

**1. Creator** - The creator pattern involves the couple, who will act as the creators of their wedding vision. They will outline their preferences, set the overall budget, and make key decisions about the ceremony and reception. By taking an active role in shaping their wedding, they ensure that their personal style and desires are reflected in every aspect of the event.

**2. Controller** - The wedding planner will serve as the controller of the wedding, responsible for coordinating all the vendors, managing the timeline, and ensuring a smooth flow of activities on the wedding day. They will act as the central point of contact, overseeing the logistics and handling any issues that may arise. The wedding planner's role is vital in ensuring that all elements of the wedding come together seamlessly.

**3. Low Coupling** - To achieve low coupling, each vendor will be assigned to handle a specific aspect of the wedding. For example, a florist will be responsible for designing and arranging the floral decorations, while a caterer will take care of the food and beverages. This approach minimizes dependencies between vendors and allows them to focus on their specialized areas of expertise.

**4. High Cohesion** - High cohesion is achieved by assigning clear responsibilities to each vendor. The venue coordinator will handle all logistical aspects, such as coordinating with the couple and managing the venue setup. The photographer will be responsible for capturing the precious moments throughout the day, while the makeup artist and hairstylist will focus on enhancing the couple's appearance. Each vendor will have a well-defined role, ensuring that all aspects of the wedding are executed professionally.

**5. Information Expert** - The wedding planner acts as the information expert, serving as the main point of contact between the couple, vendors, and wedding party. They will ensure effective communication by sharing essential information, such as the wedding timeline, vendor contracts, and any specific requirements. The wedding planner's role is critical in ensuring that all parties are informed and that the wedding day unfolds smoothly.

**6. Polymorphism** - Polymorphism is embraced by offering a variety of options to accommodate different preferences and needs. For instance, the couple may select various menu choices to cater to different dietary restrictions or provide multiple entertainment options to suit different tastes. By incorporating diverse elements, the wedding becomes more inclusive and enjoyable for all attendees.

**7. Protected Variations** - To account for unforeseen circumstances, the wedding planner will create contingency plans. This may include having an indoor backup plan in case of inclement weather or identifying alternative photo locations if the original plan becomes inaccessible. By considering potential variations, the wedding planner ensures that the event can adapt to changes while maintaining its overall vision.

**8. Pure Fabrication** - The wedding planner may collaborate with a professional decorator who specializes in creating stunning wedding decors. This individual will use their expertise to transform the ceremony and reception spaces, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive atmosphere. By relying on the decorator's artistic skills, the couple can enhance the ambiance and create a memorable setting for their special day.

By incorporating these GRASP patterns into the wedding planning process, we can create a well-structured and enjoyable event. Each pattern assigns clear responsibilities, encourages effective communication, and allows for flexibility when unexpected situations arise. This comprehensive approach ensures that the couple's vision is brought to life and that their wedding day becomes a cherished memory for all involved.
