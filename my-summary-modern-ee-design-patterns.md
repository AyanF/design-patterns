The chapter begins by highlighting the challenges faced by developers in traditional enterprise settings, including the need to work with outdated technology stacks and the lack of focus on business needs.

The author then traces the history of Java EE, starting with its inception in the late 1990s as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). J2EE was developed to provide a standard platform for enterprise application development and was based on a set of specifications for various technologies such as servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and Java Messaging Service (JMS).

However, J2EE had its limitations, including its complexity and the fact that it was not designed with modern development practices in mind. This led to the development of Java EE 5, which introduced new features such as annotations and dependency injection. Java EE 6 and 7 further improved on these features and introduced support for web sockets and JSON processing.

The chapter also discusses the challenges faced by Java EE in the face of emerging technologies such as microservices and cloud computing. While Java EE was designed for monolithic applications, microservices require a different approach to development and deployment. As a result, developers have started to adopt alternative frameworks such as Spring Boot and Dropwizard.

The chapter concludes by highlighting the importance of keeping up with the latest technologies and adapting to new paradigms in enterprise development. While Java EE has been a dominant force in enterprise development for many years, it is important for developers to be open to new approaches and technologies that can help them build scalable and sustainable applications.

## Chapter 3: Designing Software for a Scalable Enterprise

Chapter 3 focuses on designing software for a scalable enterprise. The chapter starts by discussing the difference between greenfield and brownfield projects. Greenfield projects are new projects that are built from scratch, while brownfield projects are existing projects that need to be modified or updated. The chapter then introduces domain-driven design (DDD), which is an approach to software development that focuses on understanding the business domain and building software that reflects that understanding.

The chapter also discusses service characteristics, which are the attributes that a service should have in order to be considered a microservice. These characteristics include being independently deployable, having a single responsibility, and being fully contained. The chapter provides best practices for building microservices, including using a lightweight messaging system and implementing cross-cutting concerns such as logging and monitoring.

The chapter then discusses the importance of scalability in enterprise software development. Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work or traffic without breaking down. The chapter provides several patterns for building scalable systems, including the pipeline pattern and the shared resources pattern.

The pipeline pattern is a way of breaking down a complex process into smaller, more manageable steps. Each step in the process is handled by a separate microservice, and the messages between the microservices are passed asynchronously. This allows each microservice to work independently and at its own pace, which can improve overall system performance.

The shared resources pattern is a way of handling situations where multiple microservices need to access the same data source. This can be a challenge in a microservices architecture, where each microservice is supposed to be autonomous. The shared resources pattern involves creating a separate microservice that is responsible for managing the shared data source. The other microservices can then communicate with the shared resource microservice to access the data.

Overall, Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive overview of the principles and best practices for designing software for a scalable enterprise. The chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding the business domain and building software that reflects that understanding. It also provides practical advice for building microservices and scalable systems that can handle increasing amounts of work or traffic.

## Key Takeaways

The book discusses best practices for developing and working with microservices-based architecture. The following principles have emerged as best practices for developing and working with microservices-based architecture:

- **Design for Automation:** Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach where teams produce usable software in short cycles while ensuring that they can be reliably released at any time. Achieving rapid deployment requires many continuous delivery techniques, including infrastructure automation, build automation, deployment and rollback automation, data migration automation, and test automation.

- **Design for Failure:** With applications composed of a large number of individual services, you have to deal with an exponentially growing complexity that touches all relevant parts of an application in order to measure availability and design for failure. And complexity due to more interdependencies means that failures will occur, and when they do, they can be catastrophic. The premium standard for high availability is five 9s, which stands for a guaranteed uptime of 99.999%. Over the course of a complete year, that means just five and a half minutes of downtime. Traditional approaches often use the words reliability and preventing failure interchangeably. But cloud-based microservices architectures are completely different.

- **Decentralize All the Things:** The first thing you need to do when designing a microservices architecture is to decentralize everything. This means that each service should be designed to be as independent as possible from the others, with its own data storage, processing, and communication channels.

- **Orchestrate Everything:** Once you have decentralized everything, you need to orchestrate everything. This means that you need to have a way to manage the flow of data between services, to ensure that everything is working together in the right way.

- **Automate Everything:** To make sure that everything is working together in the right way, you need to automate everything. This means that you need to have a way to automate the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of your services.

- **Design for Resilience:** To make sure that your microservices architecture is resilient, you need to design it to be able to handle failure. This means that you need to have a way to handle errors, to recover from failures, and to scale up and down as needed.

- **Monitor Everything:** To make sure that your microservices architecture is working as expected, you need to monitor everything. This means that you need to have a way to monitor the performance of your services, to track errors, and to detect anomalies.
